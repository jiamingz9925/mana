## MPI-LOGGER
The purpose of mpi-logger is to intercept MPI calls from native program without involving running MANA.
Using this tool people can compare MPI arguments between MANA and native run, in order to debug MANA.

To build, go to ./mpi-proxy-split/util/mpi-logger and run `make`

## How to run

```

## How to edit
